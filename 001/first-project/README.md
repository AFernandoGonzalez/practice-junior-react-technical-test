# Counter and API


 - [x] **1: Create a React Component** Create a React component named `Counter` that displays a button and a count. When the button is clicked, the count should increment by 1.

 - [x] **Task 2: Fetch and Display Data** Create a new component called `UserList`. Fetch a list of users from the JSON API at `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` and display their names and email addresses in a list format.

 - [x] **Task 3: State Management** Enhance the `Counter` component created in Task 1 to decrement the count when a separate button is clicked.

 - [x] **Task 4: Routing** Implement routing using React Router. Create two routes: one for the `Counter` component (Task 1) and another for the `UserList` component (Task 2). Include navigation links between the routes.

 - [x] **Task 5: Styling** Style the `Counter` and `UserList` components using CSS to make them visually appealing. You can use any styling approach you prefer (inline styles, CSS files, or CSS-in-JS).

 - [x] **Task 6: Error Handling** Handle errors in the `UserList` component. Display an error message if there is an issue fetching data from the API.

 - [x] **Task 7: Form Handling** Create a new component named `ContactForm` that contains a form with fields for name, email, and a message. When the form is submitted, display an alert with the form data.

 - [ ] **Task 8: Redux Integration (Bonus)** If you have experience with Redux, integrate it into your application to manage the state of the `Counter` component. Use Redux actions and reducers to update the count.

 - [ ] **Task 9: Unit Testing (Bonus)** Write unit tests for one of the components you've created. You can use testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
